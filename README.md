# Email Classification with BERT
This project demonstrates an email classification system that uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text preprocessing and feature extraction. The system classifies emails into predefined categories or identifies patterns for further analysis.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify emails into categories using BERT for text preprocessing. BERT allows us to generate contextual embeddings for email text, which can then be used to train a machine learning model. This project demonstrates the setup and execution of this pipeline, along with sample data for experimentation.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project on your local machine, you'll need Python and several key packages. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone this repository:
